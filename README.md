- How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, I try to figure out the simplest way to implement a solution.
Once I have that worked out, I look for ways to make it more efficient, modular, and scalable.
For the projects in this course, a lot of the design work was already done for us.
The starter code already had a well-defined structure for us to add to and tweak as needed.
With the exception of the lighting lab instructions, I found the course to be just the right amount
of challenging and informative.
In future work, I will continue to follow this design strategy.

- How do I approach developing programs?

When developing my 3D scene, I followed a step-by-step and incremental approach.
I first got the project to run, and slowly added little updates and ran the code again to validate the changes.
By doing this, I was able to build up the project to something more complex from something simple.
I did my best to incorporate the labs and milestones into my final product.

- How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

My chosen trade is data engineering. Computer science is at the heart of all I do.
By learning and deepening my understanding of the field, I am able to make better decisions and build better solutions.
Although I don't directly use graphics in anything I do, having the understanding and practical knowledge
can potentially open up doors in the future.
I love to learn. Learning the basics of computer graphics programming was a great experience.
